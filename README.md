## Resources Used

I learnt how to use create protected routes from [ Implementing Protected Route and Authentication in React-JS](https://dev.to/olumidesamuel_/implementing-protected-route-and-authentication-in-react-js-3cl4) by [Olumide Samuel](https://dev.to/olumidesamuel_)

I also benefitted from the guidance of a friend [Qasim-Yusuf](https://github.com/Qausim) who tried as much as possible to make sure I stop doubting myself and just write code. Plus also making fun of me as us.
